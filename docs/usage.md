## Tray Menu
* Each project is represented with an icon indicating the last build status. 
* If the build is still in progress, an activity indicator icon is used to indicate the server activity. 
* All projects in the configured CI servers contribute to the overall build status which is displayed in the tray. 
* Clicking on any project in the tray menu would take you to the project page on the CI server.
